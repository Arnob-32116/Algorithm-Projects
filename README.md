# Word-counting-Algorithm
Here is a simple word counting Algorithm that views how many times a word is in the string without knowing which words are in the string.
In most Pattern Matching Algorithm You have to know which words to search to find how many times the searched word is in that string.
But this Algorithm Matches all the words counts them and shows how many times they are int the string in Alphabatical order.
